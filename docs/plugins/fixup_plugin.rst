*Performs various checks and fixes to directories of audio files.*

Description
-----------

Operates on directories at a time, fixing each as a unit (album,
compilation, live set, etc.). All of these should have common dates,
for example but other characteristics may vary. The ``--type`` should be used
whenever possible, ``lp`` is the default.

The following test and fixes always apply:

    1.  Every file will be given an ID3 tag if one is missing.
    2.  Set ID3 v2.4.
    3.  Set a consistent album name for all files in the directory.
    4.  Set a consistent artist name for all files, unless the type is
        ``various`` in which case the artist may vary (but must exist).
    5.  Ensure each file has a title.
    6.  Ensure each file has a track # and track total.
    7.  Ensure all files have a release and original release date, unless the
        type is ``live`` in which case the recording date is set.
    8.  All ID3 frames of the following types are removed: USER, PRIV
    9.  All ID3 files have TLEN (track length in ms) set (or updated).
    10. The album/dir type is set in the tag. Types of ``lp`` and ``various``
        do not have this field set since the latter is the default and the
        former can be determined during sync. In ID3 terms the value is in
        TXXX (description: ``eyeD3#album_type``).
    11. Files are renamed as follows:
        - Type ``various``: ${track:num} - ${artist} - ${title}
        - Type ``single``: ${artist} - ${title}
        - All other types: ${artist} - ${track:num} - ${title}
        - A rename template can be supplied in --file-rename-pattern
    12. Directories are renamed as follows:
        - Type ``live``: ${best_date:prefer_recording} - ${album}
        - All other types: ${best_date:prefer_release} - ${album}
        - A rename template can be supplied in --dir-rename-pattern

Album types:

    - ``lp``: A traditinal "album" of songs from a single artist.
      No extra info is written to the tag since this is the default.
    - ``ep``: A short collection of songs from a single artist. The string 'ep'
      is written to the tag's ``eyeD3#album_type`` field.
    - ``various``: A collection of songs from different artists. The string
      'various' is written to the tag's ``eyeD3#album_type`` field.
    - ``live``: A collection of live recordings from a single artist. The string
      'live' is written to the tag's ``eyeD3#album_type`` field.
    - ``compilation``: A collection of songs from various recordings by a single
      artist. The string 'compilation' is written to the tag's
      ``eyeD3#album_type`` field. Compilation dates, unlike other types, may
      differ.
    - ``demo``: A demo recording by a single artist. The string 'demo' is
      written to the tag's ``eyeD3#album_type`` field.
    - ``single``: A track that should no be associated with an album (even if
      it has album metadata). The string 'single' is written to the tag's
      ``eyeD3#album_type`` field.
